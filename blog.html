            <p class="q-section"># What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</p>
            <p class="a-section">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does
                not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. <br>A unique page session gets created once a
                document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only
                saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page
                reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different
                from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own
                sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the
                duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.</p>
            <p class="q-section"># What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</p>
            <p class="a-section">Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible
                within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared
                inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular
                condition or loop. </p>
            <p class="q-section"># How the JavaScript event loop works?</p>
            <p class="a-section">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
                If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
            <p class="q-section"># How many types of undefined can we get?</p>
            <p class="a-section">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or
                statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned
                value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
